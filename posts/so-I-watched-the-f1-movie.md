# So, I watched the F1 movie today

Surely, there are a lot of use cases and jobs for computer engineers in Formula 1, right. I asked ChatGPT to give me a few system design descriptions to see if I can design them.

### System 1: Real-Time Telemetry Ingestion and Analysis System

#### Description

Simulates collecting real-time data from a Formula 1 car (e.g., speed, tire pressure, fuel levels, brake temps) and visualizes it live for engineers.

Main challenges:
- Real-time data pipelines
- Stream processing
- Low-latency storage design
- IoT message routing and filtering

#### System

**TODO**

### System 2: Race Strategy Simulator

#### Description

Given track conditions, tire wear, fuel loads, and weather, simulate race outcomes for different pit strategies. Teams use this to plan under uncertainty.

Main challenges:
- Serverless compute with orchestration
- ML model integration
- Decision-tree simulation
- Optimization under constraints

#### System

**TODO**

### System 3: Trackside to Factory Data Sync System

#### Description

During a race weekend, F1 teams send gigabytes of data (telemetry, video, audio, sensor logs) from trackside servers to their headquarters for deeper analysis.

Main challenges:
- Big data movement
- Hybrid edge/cloud architecture
- Secure access control and compliance
- ETL pipelines

#### System

**TODO**
