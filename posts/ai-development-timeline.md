# Artificial Intelligence Timeline: 2020 - 2025

*Date: 2025-06-20*

Let's start with a brief summary of AI development over the last few years.

## 2020: Transformers Go Mainstream

Transformers became mainstream in 2020, with GPT-2 and BERT. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel (unlike older RNNs which processed sequentially). This breakthrough allows them to understand relationships between words (or tokens) over long contexts. [Transformer paper - Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

### Main Applications
- **Text generation** (OpenAI GPT-2)
- **Text classification** (BERT sentiment analysis, search engines)
- **Machine translation**
- **Summarization tools** (Google Search snippets, etc.)

## 2021: Large Language Models Take Over

Large language models and multimodal AI dominated the AI landscape in 2021. LLMs are massive transformer models trained on enormous internet text corpora, capable of few-shot learning. We also saw the beginning of AI art generation with DALL-E and basic AI image understanding with CLIP.

### Main Applications
- **Chatbots**
- **AI writing assistants**
- **Basic AI image understanding** (search by text in image databases)
- **Early AI art generation** (DALL-E 1)

## 2022: Diffusion Models Everywhere

2022 was all about diffusion models, which revolutionized text-to-image generation. Diffusion models start with random noise and gradually "denoise" it into coherent images by learning the probability distribution of pixels conditioned on text prompts.

### Main Applications
- **AI image generation** from text prompts
- **Design prototyping**
- **Marketing content creation**
- **Visual storytelling tools**
- **Generative AI** for games and media

## 2023: ChatGPT Changes Everything

ChatGPT exploded in popularity with GPT-4 and the rise of multimodal assistants. LLMs were fine-tuned for conversational style using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Multimodal models began integrating text and image inputs into unified neural architectures.

### Main Applications
- **Customer support automation**
- **Personal AI assistants**
- **AI tutoring and educational tools**
- **Basic vision and text applications** (describing images, answering visual questions)
- **Code generation tools** (e.g., GitHub Copilot)

## 2024: Video Generation and Agentic Workflows

The most prominent AI development of 2024 was AI video generation and agentic workflows. AI video uses diffusion and transformer-based temporal modeling to generate video from text. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) emerged, combining LLMs with external databases or APIs. The LLM generates answers by retrieving real-time data.

### Main Applications
- **AI-generated video ads**
- **Marketing content creation**
- **Autonomous AI agents** (scheduling, workflow automation)
- **AI connected to business databases** for smarter queries

## 2025: Real-time Multimodal Interaction and AI Orchestration

This year, we're seeing a lot of real-time multimodal interaction and AI orchestration. Multimodal LLMs now offer real-time data access and orchestration capabilities. These systems process multimodal input/output (text, images, audio, video) in unified transformer models with near real-time response latency, orchestrating multiple tools, APIs, and data sources in seamless AI workflows.

### Main Applications
- **Real-time voice chat** with AI
- **AI copilots** across enterprise applications
- **Complex reasoning tasks** (e.g., financial modeling, coding assistants that use API calls, document summarization with references)
- **AI customer support** that sees images, reads PDFs, and queries databases instantly
