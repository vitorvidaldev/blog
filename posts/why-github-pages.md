*January 16, 2024*

Exploring the benefits of using GitHub Pages for a simple, fast blog.

## The Decision

When I decided to start a blog, I had several options to consider:
- WordPress
- Medium
- Custom hosting
- GitHub Pages

After evaluating each option, GitHub Pages emerged as the clear winner.

## Why GitHub Pages?

### 1. **Free Hosting**
GitHub Pages provides free hosting for static websites. No monthly fees, no hidden costs.

### 2. **Version Control**
Since it's built on Git, I get full version control for all my content. I can track changes, revert if needed, and collaborate if desired.

### 3. **Markdown Support**
GitHub Pages natively supports Markdown, making it easy to write content without worrying about HTML formatting.

### 4. **Fast Performance**
Static sites load incredibly fast, providing a great user experience.

### 5. **Custom Domain Support**
I can use my own domain name if I want to in the future.

### 6. **Easy Deployment**
Just push to the repository and the site updates automatically.

## Limitations

Of course, there are some limitations:
- No server-side processing
- No database
- Limited to static content

But for a simple blog, these limitations are actually benefits - they keep things simple and fast.

## The Setup

The setup was straightforward:
1. Create a repository
2. Add an `index.html` file
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Start writing content

## Conclusion

GitHub Pages is perfect for a simple blog. It's free, fast, and easy to maintain. The static nature actually encourages better content organization and performance.
